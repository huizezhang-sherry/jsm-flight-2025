We may need to start from the hub-and-spoke structure since it is more familiear concept for general audience, and then move to the concept of banked hubs (UA, AA) and rolling hubs (DL, WN)

bank: defined as a wave of flight arrivals at the hub from numerous spoke airport during a limited timeframe

## Rolling hub vs. banked hub

* American decided unbanking was a good plan more than a decade ago since it is cost-saving - SZ: reflected on the pattern we see in 2003 and could due to the reduction in air traffic post 911 (maybe also soaring fuel cost and economy recession - dotcom bubble as suggested by SMC) , hence the change. 

* The US Airways management team had learned long ago that the revenue benefits of a true banked hub outweighed the cost savings of a rolling hub, and they brought that strategy to the new American - SZ: after US Airway merging with American in 2013

* CLT was a US Airway hub but not an American one. After the merge, CLT becomes an American hub and hence the banked schedule pattern after 2015. 

* "Results show that depeaking tends to improve operations, but may negatively impact revenue per available seat mile (RASM)."

* A few other examples: Airlines de-banked operations at its Chicago hub in April 2002, its Dallas/Fort Worth hub in November, 2002, and its Miami
hub in May 2004 ([2, 3]). Continental Airlines de-banked its Newark hub ([3]); United Airlines de-banked its Chicago hub in 2004, its Los Angeles hub in 2005 ([4]); and Delta Airlines de-banked its Atlanta hub in January, 2005. Also closure of American Airlinesâ€™hub at Raleigh/Durham Airport, North Carolina, in 1995. 

* This wave pattern only show in well-established hub airports with extremely large passenger volumes
